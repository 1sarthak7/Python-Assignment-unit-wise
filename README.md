# Python Assignment (Unit‑Wise)

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Language-blue.svg?logo=python\&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)

This repository contains **Python programs** created as part of my academic coursework. All programs are organized **unit‑wise** according to the syllabus, making it easy to understand and revise concepts covered in each unit.

---

Each folder contains Python programs related to the topics covered in that unit.

##  Unit 1 – Python Basics

This unit focuses on the **fundamentals of Python programming**, including:

* Introduction to Python
* Variables and data types
* Input and output operations
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
* Basic problem‑solving programs

These programs help build a strong foundation in Python syntax and logic.

##  Unit 2 – Intermediate Python Concepts

This unit contains **additional and newly added programs**, covering topics such as:

* Functions and modular programming
* String manipulation
* List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary operations
* File handling (read/write operations)
* Logical and practical problem‑solving programs

All newly added programs are placed inside the **Unit‑2** folder and reflect improved understanding of Python concepts.
